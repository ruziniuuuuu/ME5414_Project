# ME5414 Project

> Author: Cao Chenyu

## Introduction

This project compares the performance of two Linear Programming (LP) solvers - the Simplex method (a non-interior point algorithm) and the Barrier method (an interior point algorithm). The solvers are evaluated based on computational effort, sensitivity to tolerances, and other factors across a set of standard LP test problems.
